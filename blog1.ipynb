    "Ever what happens when customers don't make good on their bank loans? Once a bank has decided that a debt is uncollectabled, the bank doens't just forfeit the money they are owed. Instead the bank will assign a score to the account which will assess how much money the bank is exected to recover from the customer eventually. The assessment score is a function of the total debt, the probability of the customer paying and many other features that can impact the customers ability to repay the debt. \n",

IF the debt to be recovered is not very large then a bank can just add the customer to an automatic dialing or emailing system. Howeever for larger values, broken up into thresholds, the cost put into recovery will increase by 50$\n",
